# Jet Classification with LHC data
Project in the Machine Learning for Physicists course taken during the second semester of IMAPP in TU Dortmund University.
This is a work done in pairs, where I and my project partner focused in different parts of the code including different machine learning models as additional steps.
Individual project reports were evaluated independently.

## Abstract
This project is about using machine learning models to identify jets using jet substructure information. From already simulated LHC collisions created for the study of ultra low latency inference with hls4ml, 16 features are used to classify jets into five classes, whether they are light quark __(q)__, top quark __(t)__, W boson __(W)__, Z boson __(Z)__, or gluon __(g)__ jet.
The focus in this study is to classify jets of particles from simulated LHC collisions

## Reference Paper and Dataset
In this project, we are interested to compare our model's results with the results from a study published in the following paper, using the same evaluation metrics. The reference study uses the same dataset but a different machine learning algorithm.
